## Git Basics

### git init
This command creates a new Git repository in the current folder. It sets up all the necessary files Git needs to track changes.

### git add
This command stages your changes. It tells Git which files you want to include in the next commit.

### git commit
This command saves a snapshot of your staged changes. Every commit stores a message describing what you updated.

### git push
This command uploads your local commits to a remote repository like GitHub, making your work available online.
